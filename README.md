# A Natural Language Processing Approach to Detect Inconsistencies in Death Investigation Notes Attributing Suicide Circumstances

This repository contains the source code for Detecting Suicide-Cause Annotation Inconsistencies in Death Investigation Notes.

## Abstract

**Background**: Data accuracy is essential for scientific research and policy development. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data is widely used for discovering the patterns and causing factors of death. Recent studies suggested the annotation inconsistencies within the NVDRS and the potential impact on erroneous suicide-circumstance attributions.

**Methods**: We present an empirical Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect annotation inconsistencies and adopt a cross-validation-like paradigm to identify possible label errors. We analyzed 267,804 suicide death incidents between 2003 and 2020 from the NVDRS. We measured annotation inconsistency by the degree of changes in the F-1 score.

**Results**: Our results show that incorporating the target state’s data into training the suicide-circumstance classifier brings an increase of 5.4% to the F-1 score on the target state’s test set and a decrease of 1.1% on other states’ test set.

**Conclusions**: To conclude, we present an NLP framework to detect the annotation inconsistencies, show the effectiveness of identifying and rectifying possible label errors, and eventually propose an improvement solution to improve the coding consistency of human annotators.
